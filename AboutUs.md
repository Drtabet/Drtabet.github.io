## Our team

We are a team of volunteer doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, medical students and professionals of all grades from across the plastic surgery multidisciplinary team.

## Content writing process:

All of our contributors, section leads, and consultant reviewers, are fully qualified doctors, nurses, and physiotherapists with a valid UK professional body registration currently practicing within the field. They have been selected via an open application in collaboration with PLASTA UK (the UK PLAstic Surgery Trainee Association) or invited by the section leads for their particular experience in a subspecialist area.<br> 
Each section within the app is led by a registrar with special interest in that particular area of plastic surgery (i.e. Burns, Trauma, Skin, Elective, or Skills).<br> 
Consultant reviewers all hold full membership with BAPRAS (the British Association of Plastic Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons) and are practicing surgeons with specialist interest in the subject of the page they are reviewing<br> 
The section lead and his/her team of content contributors set up a curriculum of pages that they believe would be of use to juniors in plastic surgery. The first draft of those pages are then created by the content contributors. That draft is then reviewed and edited by the section lead, before being approved by our consultant reviewers. The finalised page is then checked for usability and style-match with the rest of the App before integration into the BurnsPlastics App.<br> 
Regular updates are performed on the app adding new features and pages of relevance to the multidisciplinary body of professionals working in plastic surgery. All pages within the app are reviewed at a minimum yearly for changes in practice.<br> 
All the contributors, leads, and consultant reviewers are volunteers and have no financial incentive from this application.<br> 
If you would like to contribute to the content writing of this application, please follow us on twitter @BurnsPlasitcs or join the PLASTA newsletter where we will be announcing as we expand our team and recruit new contributors.

## Collaborations:
This App was created in close partnership with PLASTA UK (the UK PLAstic Surgery Trainee Association) and is badged by BAPRAS (the British Association of Plastic Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons)

## Funding / sponsors:

This app aims to remain completely free to the end user for the greater benefit of the plastic surgery community as a whole. Minimal and non-intrusive sponsorship is used within the App to keep it financially self-sufficient. Funding for the creation of this application was received from multiple sources:

### Personal funds:

Mr. Patrick Tabet (Project lead for this application)

### Grants:

- BAPRAS (the British Association of Plastic Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons)


### Sponsors:
Our sponsors have no input or creative control over the content within the application. They are however invited to select the pages they would like to sponsor that are most relevant to them

- PRASIS (Plastic Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons Indemnity Scheme) : Funded the creation of 3 pages relevant to patient consent (Burns procedures consent, Trauma procedures consent, and Skin procedures consent)


### Direct donations:
We have not received any direct donations for the creation of this project.
If you would like to support this project financially, please contact us directly.

## MHRA compliance

The version of the application you are using is not a medical device and should not be used as such. It is purely to be used for educational purposes.

Simple and easily verifiable calculators have been included within this application per Appendix 2 of the MHRA guidance: stand-alone software including apps (including IVDMDs) v1.06. Those do not require registration of this software as a medical device. If you believe we are in breach of your local regulation or find one of our calculators providing incorrect results, please report the specific page using the report button on the button at the bottom of the page.

A future version of this application will be released in select markets as a medical device with more complex calculators and widgets.
