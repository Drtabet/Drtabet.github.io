## Our team

We are a team of volunteer doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, medical students and professionals of all grades from across the plastic surgery multidisciplinary team.

## Content writing process:

All of our contributors, section leads, and consultant reviewers, are fully qualified doctors, nurses, and physiotherapists with a valid UK professional body registration currently practicing within the field. They have been selected via an open application in collaboration with PLASTA UK (the UK PLAstic Surgery Trainee Association) or invited by the section leads for their particular experience in a subspecialist area.

Each section within the app is led by a registrar with special interest in that particular area of plastic surgery (i.e. Burns, Trauma, Skin, Elective, or Skills).

Consultant reviewers all hold full membership with BAPRAS (the British Association of Plastic Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons) and are practicing surgeons with specialist interest in the subject of the page they are reviewing

The section lead and his/her team of content contributors set up a curriculum of pages that they believe would be of use to juniors in plastic surgery. The first draft of those pages are then created by the content contributors. That draft is then reviewed and edited by the section lead, before being approved by our consultant reviewers. The finalised page is then checked for usability and style-match with the rest of the App before integration into the BurnsPlastics App.

Regular updates are performed on the app adding new features and pages of relevance to the multidisciplinary body of professionals working in plastic surgery. All pages within the app are reviewed at a minimum yearly for changes in practice.

All the contributors, leads, and consultant reviewers are volunteers and have no financial incentive from this application.

If you would like to contribute to the content writing of this application, please follow us on twitter @BurnsPlasitcs or join the PLASTA newsletter where we will be announcing as we expand our team and recruit new contributors.
