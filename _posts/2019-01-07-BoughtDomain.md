## Started the development of the app:

I made the decision not to take my MRCS Part 1 today, so I started to develop this app.
Ive had this project in mind for a while from my FY2 year in Broomfield hospital and I think i finally havee a bit of time to finally be able to bring it to fruition.


I decided to use Unity for the app developement because: 

* I know how to use it
* No need to learn a new langueage ( C# is great !!)
* It's easy to collaborate
* I can develop for both Android and IOS
* Possible to host online via Web-GL
* Great potential for expansion in to 3D for anatomical models or for AR features

Some Cons of using Unity:
* Will not be "Native code" to the platform and therefore won't be as snappy
* Not designed specifically for UI based apps
* Not Ideal for vector graphics

Overall I think that it will work out well for the purposes of the project !!
