## Finally settled on a logo !!

It took way too long for me to decide, but i've finally got a workable logo.

Plastic surgery as a tough field to boild down to a simple image.  
Most lay people imagine us doing cosmetic rhinoplasties and breast lifts all day, while in fact at a junior level we never deal with cosmetic procedures, and the App does not target cosmetic surgeons.  
If you lookup on the app store / play store "Plastic Surgery", you'll also be flooded with beautifying apps and virtual makeups. compare this to "Cardithoracic Surgery" or others.  
A propper logo for my app needs to appeal directly to doctors, while being ininteresting to the average lay person.

My initial thoughts was to use a recognizable flap design for my logo (i.e: Z- plasty or V-Y) so that it would catch the attention of doctors in the field while being completely benign and unintersting to everyone else. But a fter a few sketchbook trials, I found out it would just be too ugly and crowded.
I then decided to open my textbook and find another flap that would be recognizable. I decided to go with a hatchet flap on a face.
A couple of trials later I realize it's not immediately understandable, way too crowded when shrunk down.

A few days later after discussing a fiend of mine with general computing design experience, I moved on to anatomical drawings.  
I started with neck anatomy, but quickly moved on to palm structures with palmar arches, nerves and tendons. That was also too crowded but did like the idea of having a hand in my logo.

When I decided to hit tendon zones, I knew I was onto something. I initially started by going the bone route with a fracture, but I taught It looked a bit too Orthopaedic. Tendons however, they're our thing.

Finally the polishing. Border or no border ? Writing on the logo or not? Circle, square or straight up hand outline?
A few trials later and I was set.

From that point onwards, my app had a face!! -Or a hand print I guess.
