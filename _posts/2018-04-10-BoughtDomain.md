Just bought my domain today.

My page is hosted on Github.com and I bought my domain on domains.google.com

The process of linking the page to the domain went seemlessly thanks to this [artice](https://medium.com/@Tnylnc/tnylnc-how-to-set-up-github-pages-with-google-domains-83bd5a4fbc5c) by medium.com

it took  about 24 hours for the domain to be visible
