## Say No to ugly design!

When starting out, I never had a clear vision for my UI, but one thing was sure, it wasn't gona be ugly.  
When moving into the development world, many scientifically minded people tend to forget about the user experience. They design an app for a purpose and that's what to app does, "the rest is useless fluff". 
I tend to think slightly differently. Yes, my primary objective is to get my information across, but I'm also expecting my user to have a pleasant experience on the way there, and a decent looking Main menu sets the bar for what's to come.  

I kept my color backgrounds in pastel-y shades for them to be easy on the eyes and selected a representative image to each subsection of plastic surgery.  
My images were redrawn and modified to fit the message I wanted to come across and I used mild gradient to separate my foreground from my background and kept my lines simples and smooth without too much detail.  
Thinking forwards, I have also made a point to separate the sub-compotents ( sparated scalpel from hand, Melanoma from skin...) of my images to increase future potential for animation to make the menu more dynamic (that might be a project for later on).

Not sure about font selection though.
