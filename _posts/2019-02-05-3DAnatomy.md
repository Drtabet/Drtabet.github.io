## 3D anatomy for better visualization.  

One trouble I used to get when learning about hand anatomy was figuring out the depth of the various structures (eg are the nerves above or under the palmar arch ?).  
Now you will be able to see it in 3D.

I got this hand model from an old project I was working on a while ago for Augmented reality (AR) anatomy. Unfortunately this project was aborted as I didn't have enough time and the AR tecnology was not as developped as it is now. I am happy to see it become useful now, and if it all goes well the app might get some AR features afterall.  

We can only rotate the hand about so far, and the colors aren't quite right; but with a bit of time poured into this we can get it to look better, name structures, control visualization of systems, and even animate or show pathologies.
