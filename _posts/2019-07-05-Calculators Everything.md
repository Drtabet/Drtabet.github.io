## Why not automate it?

One of my main gripe with medicine is the need to remember so many scoring systems and staging systems. Is it stage one below 2mm or below 3mm? is that the latest guideline or did they change that again? so many questions that can be solved with a nicely designed tool.

###Introducing calculators!

There are any medical calculators out there, however they are often more geared towards general medical practice and fail to deliver for many specialities. So we have decided to fill those gaps.
The first wave of calculator we are implementing includes:
* Modified baux score (whoever expected clinicians to do exponentials without a calculator is crazy)
* Melanoma stager (to keep up to date with the latest guidelines)
* LRINEC Scoring (to justify your decisions in nec fasc)
* Burns fluid calculations (we also included the Muir Barkley equation if that's your thing)
* SCORTEN (because you foget it exists until you need it)
* Local anaesthetic dose calculator (you'll surprise many people that use 2% lidocaine plain)
* A simple age calculator (if, like me, you're ashamed to ask people's age right after asking for their date of birth)

Many more are planned and will come along as we keep identifying new ways to simplify our daily practice.
