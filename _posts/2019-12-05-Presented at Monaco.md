## Presented at Monaco:

I have had the honor of presenting my progress at the 2019 BAPRAS Winter Scientific Meeting in lovely Monaco! The weather was great, but unfortunately most of the marina was under construction, this did not prevent me from walking the city and eating delicious food.

The beauty of those large meetings is really the ability to meet people and discover what the rest of the world is working on.

My talk was really well recieved, and the feedback was great.
The key questions that people have raised up are :
* Why not make it paid? I would totally pay 10£ for it!
* How is it different from the BSSH hand trauma App?
* When can i use it?!

Here are the answers that I have given:

### Why not make it paid? I would totally pay 10£ for it!

Unfortunately most of our users are not expected to be Monaco attending consultant plastic surgeons with disposable income. We expect most of them to be:

* Plastic surgeons in training
* Medical students with student debt
* Doctors from other specialities (Such as A+E, GP, Orthopaedics...) not necessarily wanting to spend money on an App that may or may not be useful
* Nurses and associated healthcare workers in plastic surgery wanting to understand the field.

No matter the price tag, having to spend money to access it will be the biggest obstacle for user aquisition.

### How is it different from the BSSH hand trauma App?

Many other apps out there are great at what they do. However it is important to understand their objectives and target audience. From my understanding the BSSH hand trauma App's aim is to help A+E perform adequate first steps in the management of hand traumas, and refer adequately to their tertiary care centres.

Our app is targeted at doctors within the speciality, and does not limit itself to hand trauma alone. We aim to cover the whole gamut of plastic surgery. Although we would love to be used by A+E staff, we do not cover referral adequacy and early management steps in an algorythmic fascion as the BSSH App does.

### When can i use it?!

Unfortunately, MHRA regulation requires us to register as a Class 1 medical device before distribution in Europe specifically. Many medical App developers forgo registration as it is poorly enforced, however we have decided to stay on the right side of the law and take the necesssary steps prior to release. We are furthermore waiting to create more features and rafine our user experience before a V1.0 release. 
You can however already try out our beta version on the "Web-App" section of this website.
