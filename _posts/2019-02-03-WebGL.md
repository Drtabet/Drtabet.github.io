## We are now online foor everyone

Now that we have a website, I was able to build a web version of the app.  
This will allow us to distribute the app to a greater audiance, without a need to download the app to your device.  

I have made the Web-App playable in two ways : Within our weebsite, or stand alone in browser. That way it can be easier t bookmark and zoom into on phones or PCs if the user doesn't want to load our web page with every use.

I can see this being really useful in hospital A+E or plastics trauma assessment units where the link would be pout on the desktop and accessed for fast references.  
  
IOS users can also now try it out while we get a developer license.
