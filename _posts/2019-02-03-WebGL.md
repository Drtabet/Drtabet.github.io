## We are now online

Now that we have a website, I was able to build a web version of the app.
This will allow us to distribute the app to a greater audiance, without a need to download the app to your device.
I can see this being really useful in hospital A+E or plastics trauma assessment units where the link would be pout on the desktop and accessed for fast refereces.
