The App is currently in active development, but as it is already becoming more useful we have decided to make it available online for anyone to try and share at this early phase.  

The Burns and Plastics Doctor Helper App is **still in Beta**, so is this website. Not all features are currently functional and some of the content might be buggy and information inaccurate.

**Try the web version from your [PC or mobile here (press ok and zoom browser to fit your screen)](http://burnsplastics.com/WebApp)**  
**Download the latest beta android version [from here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fn15ADOJQkXebSfUBVn0F0pVSWe2MKry)** (Allow unknown sources under Settings -> Security -> Unkown sources) 

Unfortunately, IOS beta version is not available at present, but the [web-app](http://burnsplastics.com/WebApp) should be functiontional straight in your browser.

Discuss our app online and give us feedback on our [Reddit Page](https://reddit.com/r/BurnsAndPlasticsApp), or email us directly via the home page form.
