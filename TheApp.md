The App is currently in active development, but as it is already becoming more useful we have decided to make it available online for anyone to try and share at this early phase.  

The Burns and Plastics Doctor Helper App is **still in Beta**, so is this website. Not all features are currently functional and some of the content might be buggy and information inaccurate.

**Try the web version from your [PC or mobile here (press ok and zoom browser to fit your screen)](http://burnsplastics.com/WebApp)**  
**Download the latest android version [from here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ncJ7cwmaJF-6_x2mjz_RCXq1Py2heUZW)**

Unfortunately, no IOS beta version will be released, but the web-app should be functiontional straight in your browser.

Discuss our app and give us feedback on our [Reddit Page](https://reddit.com/r/BurnsAndPlasticsApp), or email us directly.
