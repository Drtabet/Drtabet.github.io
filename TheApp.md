The App is currently in active development, but as it is already becoming more useful we have decided to make it available online for anyone to try and share at this early phase.  

The Burns and Plastics Doctor Helper App is **still in Beta**, so is this website. Not all features are currently functional and some of the content might be buggy and information inaccurate. We are not responsible for your use of the app.

The android version is in active development and will be available soon.
**Try the web version from your [PC or mobile here (press the ok button if prompted)](http://burnsplastics.com/WebApp)**  

Unfortunately, IOS beta version is not available at present, but the [web-app](http://burnsplastics.com/WebApp) should be functiontional straight in your browser. If it isn't working in safari, use google chrome.

Discuss our app online and give us feedback on our [Reddit Page](https://reddit.com/r/BurnsAndPlasticsApp), or email us directly via the home page form.
