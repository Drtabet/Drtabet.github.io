## I spent too much time on this.

I recently did my first escharotomies, so I decided to produce an escharotomy page.

The more I was looking into it, I realised there is no great all-in-one resource that describes both the escharotomy incision lines and the anatomy on emust be weary about that you might cross while performing your escharotomies.

So I created it.

I had to compile multiple anatomical images to isolate the region I was interested about, in the right angle, and with the right structures. It took me a few days, buts it's now done !!

The only thing left to add is potentially to draw on top of the lines the escharotomy incision path to really accentuate when the "cross-over" with the structure in question will happen.
