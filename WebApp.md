The App is currently in active development, but as it is already becoming more useful we have decided to make it available online for anyone to try and share at this early phase.  

The Burns and Plastics Doctor Helper App is **still in Beta**, so is this website. Not all features are currently functional and some of the content might be buggy and information inaccurate.


On mobile press the OK button for app to load.  
On PC use mouse as you would your finger on a touch screen.
